## SrgantMooMoo
Hi there, i'm  SrgantMooMoo. I got into coding around July 2020 and it's something I genuinly enjoy doing now.  I know java pretty well now and also know html and css. The majority of my projects right now have to do with minecraft modding. I eventually want to get into c, c++, python, and JavaScript, and maybe more some day.

## Projects 
- postman, a public minecraft forge 1.12.2 client for anarchy servers.
  - postman.++, a psif extenstion of postman with a few exclusive features.
- Moo Base, a public minecraft forge 1.12.2 client base, meant to be as simple as possible for anyone to use.
- get-on-top-of.me, a personal website i'm doing for fun, and will help me start getting into html and web development a little more.
- Las Venturas, a private minecraft 1.12.2 client in mcp that i'm mostly doing for the fun of it.
- beach house, a private minecraft 1.16.4 fabirc client for anarchy i'm working on to get accustomed to fabric and 1.16.4 modding.
